#+title: Progress Tracker

* The progress tracker

This org file is used to track the progress and see upcoming updates of this repository.

* Paper to-dos:
** TODO Type Elimination rewrite
** TODO 2nd order symbolic function investigation for alpha concretization
** TODO a new algorithm for concretizing alpha?
** TODO Write heuristics for what makes our generated solution good
- Reasonable use assumption
- If a missing type is generic, our code also generates it as generic types
- alpha will always try to be one of its sub/super types; therefore the least number of types are generated

* Implementation to-do:
** TODO API rewrite
** TODO replacement of \tau into one of its choices (kind of done)
** TODO Distinguish between InferenceVariable, AnyReplaceable (just some attribute that is to be replaced with something else) and Alpha
** TODO conflict checking and resolution in type hierarchy
** TODO combining methods
** TODO method call site type argument choices (might not be needed)
** TODO subtype/equivalence assertions
** TODO has method assertion

* Benchmark to-do:
** TODO find out how to create a benchmark lol
